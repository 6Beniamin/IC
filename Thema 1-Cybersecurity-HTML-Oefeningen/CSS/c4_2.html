                <h3>The fellowship of the ring</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this first part of *The Lord of the Rings*, Frodo Baggins, a simple hobbit from the Shire, inherits the One Ring from his uncle, Bilbo. The wizard Gandalf discovers the Ring's dark origin, revealing it to be the key to the Dark Lord Sauron’s power. Frodo sets out on a journey to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, accompanied by Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Gandalf, and his hobbit friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they face the dangers of the Ringwraiths, Saruman’s treachery, and the treacherous paths of the Mines of Moria.</p>
                <p><strong>Key themes:</strong> The formation of the Fellowship, the burden of responsibility placed on Frodo, and the exploration of friendship and bravery are central to this part of the story. Additionally, the corrupting influence of power, as seen with Boromir’s temptation by the Ring, is a significant theme.</p></p>

                <h3>The two towers</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>In the second book, the Fellowship is broken. Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor, guided by Gollum, the former Ring-bearer, whose conflicting desires create tension. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue Merry and Pippin, who were captured by orcs. The trio eventually reunites with Gandalf, now resurrected as Gandalf the White. Together, they join the kingdom of Rohan in their fight against Saruman’s armies at Helm’s Deep. Merry and Pippin escape the orcs and meet Treebeard, an Ent, and help rally the Ents to destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold.</p>
                <p><strong>Key themes:</strong>This book deals with themes of separation, trust, and the personal growth of characters, especially with Frodo’s increasing burden and Aragorn stepping into a leadership role. The Two Towers also explores the impact of war, environmental destruction (via Saruman’s deforestation), and the balance between good and evil.</p>

                <h3>The return of the king</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The final part of *The Lord of the Rings* follows the culmination of the War of the Ring. Aragorn claims his rightful place as King of Gondor and leads his armies against Sauron’s forces. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam face increasing danger as they draw closer to Mount Doom. Gollum’s treachery almost results in Frodo’s failure, but Sam’s loyalty helps them continue. In the end, Frodo reaches Mount Doom, but the Ring’s power overwhelms him, and he claims it for himself. However, Gollum intervenes, biting off Frodo’s finger and accidentally falling into the fire, destroying the Ring and Sauron’s power.</p>
                <p><strong>Key themes:</strong> Themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the consequences of power are central to this book. Aragorn’s rise as a king, Frodo’s internal struggle with the Ring, and the ultimate victory of good over evil are key plot points. The bittersweet ending reflects on the personal toll the journey has taken on Frodo, who, despite his success, cannot find peace in the Shire and departs for the Undying Lands with the elves.</p>
